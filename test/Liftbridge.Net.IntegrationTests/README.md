A running Liftbridge cluster is required by the integration tests.
Documentation on how to set up a development cluster is found in the official [Liftbridge documentation](https://liftbridge.io/docs/deployment.html#docker-compose).

## Run integration tests
Change directory to `test/Liftbridge.Net.IntegrationTests` and run `dotnet test`
